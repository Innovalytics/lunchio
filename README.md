## Helping families plan nutritious meals

According to Childhood Obesity Foundation obesity in children has almost doubled from 1978 to 2007. For most children this trend continues into adulthood - where it contributes to a vast number of health problems, effectively reducing quality of life and contributing to billions of dollars in healthcare costs.

To stop this pattern of poor health it is critical to encourage healthy lifestyles in children starting from a young age. Lunchio is a new service that aims to mitigate the obesity epidemic by emphasizing the importance of healthy nutrition.

Lunchio is a fun, user-friendly site where children are given the chance to decide what they will eat while being encouraged to make healthy meal choices. Based on data provided by the Canadian government and a unique algorithm which assigns health points to meal choices, Lunchio turns traditionally cumbersome meal-planning into a fun game the whole family can be involved in. Children will be able to engage in friendly competition with other family members, friends and classmates to eat balanced, nutritious meals.

Future releases of Lunchio can incorporate point systems for parents, suggested meals, outputs that can be provided to children`s physicians, shopping lists, dietary restrictions (vegetarianism, diabetes), and a physical activity component - thereby providing a comprehensive, health profile tracker.
